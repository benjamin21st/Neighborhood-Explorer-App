#Neighborhood Explorer App#
##What is it##
**Neighborhood Explorer** is a single page web application that uses the Google Maps and FourSquare API to show users interesting places around the location they just queried.

##How to use##
Using **Neighborhood Explorer** is simple, search a location in the search bar, it can be a detailed address or the name of a city, then press "enter" key. If the location on the map is what you were looking for (Dont'be surprised if you got a "shanghai" in United States), then click the **"Check for fun places in this area"** button. Then you should see a list of fun places recommended by FourSquare and their respective location marked on the map.

If you want to learn more about each location, you can either click on the marker, or the corresponding list item.
